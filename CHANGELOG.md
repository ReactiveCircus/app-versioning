## 0.4.0

This is the final release of the plugin that's compatible with **Android Gradle Plugin 4.0 and 4.1**.

Starting from the next release, the latest version of AGP (currently `4.2.0-alpha13`) will be required, until the new variant APIs become stable which is expected to happen with AGP 5.0.
